# leetcode-problems

A repo for doing leetcode problems and stuff

Do whatever you want with this code, but you should probably at least try the problems on your own.

## The Super Mario Effect

I highly recommend [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0) by Mark Rober.

Mark illustrates that negative reinforcement is a very bad strategy for learning.

"By reframing the learning process, the fear of failure is often taken off the table and learning comes more naturally.‚Äù\
\- Mark Rober

This is why we do things in our own sandbox. The pressure of hitting 'submit' and being told we are not good enough is counterproductive to the learning process. Add to that the statistics on our profile pages reinforcing the social media-esque comparison mechanisms by which we all have been negatively affected over the years, but I digress.

leetcode sucks.
